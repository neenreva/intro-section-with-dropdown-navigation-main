## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Users should be able to:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Blanket statement incoming: I've found that I keep building more and more complexity into these challenges and you have to keep going back on the things you've learned in the past to update them and find how they incorporate into the extra details your newly learned element has added. This is still messy(css) and I've broken down and rewrote it 3x already. Doing it over allowed me to rewrite where which class properties needed to go to work between the hamburger nav and mobile-first workflow.  

### Continued development

The bigger picture here is finding how I can implement a more standard approach like BEM in my structure to help sort out the madness. I've kind of started with my class naming but need to take the deep dive to understand all the 'whys'.

### Useful resources

- [PixelPerfect](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) - Overlay that really helps with the sizing of the elements.

### As always feedback is welcome! Thanks for checking this out.
